How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    difficult to use diff. It is not user friendly

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Go back to older versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    cons: commits too big/too small. pros: commit can have logical features

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because often for one logical functionality you need to make changes to one commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see the commits. git diff to see difference between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    we can go back to a version that does not break the thing

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    use git & github to manage office projects
